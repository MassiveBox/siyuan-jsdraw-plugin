# SiYuan js-draw Plugin

This plugin allows you to embed js-draw whiteboards anywhere in your SiYuan documents.

## Usage instructions
- Install the plugin from the marketplace. You can find it by searching for `js-draw`. 
- To add a new drawing to your document:
  1. Type `/Insert Drawing` in your document, and select the correct menu entry
  2. The whiteboard editor will open in a new tab. Draw as you like, then click the Save button and close the tab.
- To edit the image later:
  1. Right-click on the image (or click the three dots on mobile), select "Plugin" > "Edit with js-draw" in the menu
  2. The editor tab will open, edit your file as you like, then click the Save button and close the tab.

## Contributing
Contributions are always welcome! Right now, I'm working on the core functionality and fixing bugs.  
After that is done, I will need help with the internationalization, as, unfortunately, I don't speak Chinese.  
Please [contact me](mailto:box@massive.box) if you'd like to help!
